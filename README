----------------------------------------
    1.  Description
----------------------------------------

    namegen is a program that generates pseudo-random names according to the
    arguments given and the files from which it reads.  These files are named
    'firstnames_male.txt', 'firstnames_female.txt' and 'surnames.txt'
    respectively, and all are contained within the namegen data directory.  By
    default this directory is located at /usr/share/namegen/data, though it may
    be different on your installation.



----------------------------------------
    2.  Requirements / Restrictions
----------------------------------------

    In addition to the aforementioned files, this program uses the following C
    headers: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, time.h, ctype.h and getopt.h.  If
    you're able to compile C programs on your system, chances are good that
    you'll be able to compile this without issues, though if you're having
    problems feel free to poke around and adjust the headers in the source code.



----------------------------------------
    3.  Installation / Uninstallation
----------------------------------------

    To build, compile the program with 'make'.  It shouldn't take long, though
    obviously you'll need a C compiler.  If you're on any modern UNIX or Linux
    distro you should already have one, and if you don't, shame on you.  Go
    install GCC (gcc.gnu.org) right away.

    After compiling the binary with 'make', install with 'make install' using
    superuser privileges.

    To uninstall the program, use 'make uninstall' with superuser privileges.
